Comparison of ECDFs

ECDFs also allow you to compare two or more distributions (though plots get cluttered if you have too many). Here, you will plot ECDFs for the petal lengths of all three iris species. You already wrote a function to generate ECDFs so you can put it to good use!

To overlay all three ECDFs on the same plot, you can use plt.plot() three times, once for each ECDF. Remember to include marker='.' and linestyle='none' as arguments inside plt.plot().

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('../datasets/iris.csv')

setosa_petal_length = df[df.species == 'setosa']['petal length (cm)'].values
versicolor_petal_length = df[df.species == 'versicolor']['petal length (cm)'].values
virginica_petal_length = df[df.species == 'virginica']['petal length (cm)'].values

'''
INSTRUCTIONS

*   Compute ECDFs for each of the three species using your ecdf() function. The variables setosa_petal_length, versicolor_petal_length, and virginica_petal_length are all in your namespace. Unpack the ECDFs into x_set, y_set, x_vers, y_vers and x_virg, y_virg, respectively.
*   Plot all three ECDFs on the same plot as dots. To do this, you will need three plt.plot() commands. Assign the result of each to _.
*   A legend and axis labels have been added for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see all the ECDFs!
